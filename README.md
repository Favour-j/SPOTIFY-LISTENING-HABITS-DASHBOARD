## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores personal Spotify listening data collected over a 30-day period. Using Power BI and Python, I built an interactive dashboard to uncover listening patterns by day, time, artist, and track.

The analysis highlights top artists, most played songs, peak listening periods, and general music behavior insights to demonstrate real-world application of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
